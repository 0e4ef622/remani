- [x] Keysounds ~~(waiting on judgement)~~
- [ ] Finish the ojn module (all that I really need is to calculate the time of a note from it's measure number, but the bpm can change and I'm unsure on what a "[measure fraction](https://open2jam.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-notes-section/)" is)
- [ ] The rest of the TODOs in the osu module
- [ ] Fix current\_timing\_point\_index management
- [ ] Options menu ~~(waiting on config system)~~
