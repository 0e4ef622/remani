remani [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/0e4ef622/remani.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/0e4ef622/remani)
==============================================

Remake of o2jam/osumania written in Rust.

Basically a 7k VSRG that aims to support multiple skin formats (for gameplay at least) and multiple chart formats.

The goal is not to _emulate_ other games, it's just to mimick the interface so that you don't have to learn how to read
a new skin.
